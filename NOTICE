# Attributions

Firstly, huge credit is due to Rapptz for creating [discord.py][discord.py],
without which I would not have been able to create dissonance. Thanks is also
due to Hammer & Chisel Inc. for making [Discord][discord.gg], the best chat app
I've ever used. Even in its incomplete state, it's still far better than any
of the competition. Finally, shoutouts to SolarPolarMan, who got me into this 
in the first place. Check out [his YouTube channel][solarpolarman]!
